"What is data sovereignty?","Data is subject to the laws of the country where it is stored or processed."
"Why is data sovereignty important?","It affects legal compliance, especially with data privacy laws."
"What is an example of data sovereignty regulation?","GDPR in the European Union."
"Why must organizations know data location?","To understand which country’s laws apply to their data."
"What is geolocation?","Identifying the physical location of a device or object."
"What technologies are used for geolocation?","GPS, IP mapping, Wi-Fi positioning, cell tower data."
"What is context-aware access control?","Restricting access based on the user’s physical location."
"What is content restriction in security?","Blocking content based on the user's geographic region."
"How does geolocation help in fraud prevention?","Detects logins or actions from unexpected locations."
"What is geofencing?","A virtual boundary that controls access based on user location—e.g., only allowing access to files when inside a company building."
"What technologies are used to determine user location?","IP address/subnet, GPS, Wi-Fi positioning (SSID databases), cell tower data."
"What is the purpose of geographic restrictions?","To control access to data based on the user's or data's physical location."
"Why is data protection important across all locations and states?","Data exists in many forms and places, each with different attack surfaces requiring consistent protection."
"What is encryption?","The process of transforming plaintext into unreadable ciphertext using an algorithm and a key to ensure confidentiality."
"How is encrypted data made readable again?","By using decryption with the correct key."
"What is confusion in encryption?","A feature where ciphertext appears random and has no resemblance to the plaintext."
"What is hashing?","A one-way function that converts data into a fixed-size hash value to ensure data integrity and secure password storage."
"Is hashing reversible?","No, hashing is non-reversible—you cannot retrieve the original input from the hash."
"What are key uses of hashing?","Data integrity checks, password storage, digital signatures, and collision resistance."
"What is a hash collision?","When two different inputs produce the same hash value, compromising the hash's reliability."
"What is the avalanche effect in hashing?","A small change in input causes a large, unpredictable change in the hash output."
"What is obfuscation?","Making code or data hard to read without changing its function—often used to deter analysis or reverse engineering."
"Is obfuscation the same as encryption?","No, obfuscation is not encryption and can often be reversed."
"What is data masking?","A form of obfuscation that hides parts of sensitive data by replacing them with non-sensitive characters (e.g., ****1234)."
"When is data masking used?","In reports, receipts, or dev environments to protect PII or financial data."
"What is tokenization?","Replacing sensitive data with a token, which is meaningless if stolen. The original data is stored securely in a vault."
"How does tokenization differ from encryption?","Tokenization has no algorithmic reversal; it uses a lookup in a secure token vault."
"What is a use case for tokenization?","Mobile payments like Apple Pay or Google Pay, where card numbers are replaced with tokens."
"What is segmentation in cybersecurity?","Dividing a network or storage into smaller sections to contain breaches and apply targeted controls."
"What are benefits of segmentation?","Limits breach impact, allows more granular security for sensitive areas."
"What is access control?","Restricting data access based on identity and privileges, using authentication and authorization."
"What is the principle of least privilege?","Users should only have the minimum access needed to perform their job."
