"What is the primary purpose of change control processes?","To manage system modifications systematically, preventing disruptions while ensuring updates function correctly"
"What triggers a formal change request?","Identified need from application/data owners detailing reason, scope, and schedule for modification"
"What three elements does a Change Control Board (CCB) assess?","1. Implementation risks 2. Organizational impact 3. Approval viability"
"What constitutes stakeholder analysis in change management?","Identifying all affected parties and evaluating financial/system availability consequences"
"Why are sandbox environments critical for testing?","They provide isolated replicas of production systems for safe change validation"
"What three components define a rollback plan?","1. Backout procedures 2. System backups 3. Restoration verification steps"
"When are high-risk changes typically implemented?","During scheduled maintenance windows or off-peak hours to minimize user impact"
"What verification occurs post-implementation?","User testing and system validation to confirm functionality meets requirements"
"How does change control integrate with security policies?","By mandating documentation, authorization, and controlled execution of all modifications"
"What example demonstrates change control in logistics?","Printer upgrade tested in sandbox, deployed off-hours, with rollback capability"
"What distinguishes allow lists from deny lists?","Allow lists permit only approved apps; deny lists block specific prohibited apps"
"Why document legacy systems in change management?","To enable maintenance despite lacking vendor support and internal expertise"
"What challenge do 24/7 systems pose for updates?","Requiring redundant systems and automated failover to maintain continuous availability"
"What three reboot types might changes require?","1. Full OS restart 2. Hardware power cycle 3. Service/daemon reload"
"Why track system dependencies during changes?","Some updates require prerequisite modifications to interconnected services/servers"
"What four elements does version control track?","1. Software patches 2. Configuration changes 3. Registry edits 4. Historical versions"
"What critical function do CCB documents serve?","Define permissible change scope and technician authority limits"
"How are users notified about scheduled changes?","Via email alerts and shared Change Control calendars with maintenance timelines"
"What makes legacy application updates challenging?","Obsolete codebases, discontinued support, and specialized knowledge requirements"
"What security risk does undocumented change create?","Potential system vulnerabilities from unauthorized/unverified modifications"
