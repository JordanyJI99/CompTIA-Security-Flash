"What is port security in networking?","Securing individual switch/wireless ports to prevent unauthorized device access."
"What three roles exist in 802.1X authentication?","1) Supplicant (client) 2) Authenticator (switch) 3) Authentication Server (RADIUS/LDAP)."
"What is EAP's function in port security?","Provides a flexible framework for authentication methods over wired/wireless networks."
"How does 802.1X initially treat new connections?","Blocks all traffic until successful authentication occurs (default deny policy)."
"What common protocol do authentication servers use?","RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) for centralized credential verification."
"What's the office building analogy for 802.1X?","Badge reader (authenticator) checks ID card (supplicant) against security database (auth server)."
"Why implement port security on switches?","Prevents unauthorized devices from gaining network access by simply plugging into ports."
"What happens after successful 802.1X authentication?","Authenticator opens the port and allows normal network traffic flow."
"What's the difference between EAP and 802.1X?","EAP is an authentication framework, while 802.1X is the standard implementing port-based NAC."
"What devices typically act as authenticators?","Network switches and wireless access points enforcing access control."
"What security risk does port security mitigate?","Unauthorized physical access to network ports (e.g., rogue devices in office Ethernet jacks)."
"How does MAC filtering differ from 802.1X?","MAC filtering uses static addresses (easily spoofed), while 802.1X requires dynamic authentication."
"What happens if 802.1X authentication fails?","Port remains blocked or may assign the device to a restricted VLAN (guest/quarantine network)."
"What is the primary function of a firewall?","Control traffic flow between networks based on security rules."
"What distinguishes NGFWs from traditional firewalls?","NGFWs operate at Layer 7 (application awareness) vs Layer 4 (port-based) filtering."
"What three capabilities define NGFWs?","1) Application identification 2) Deep packet inspection 3) Integrated IPS features."
"How does a WAF differ from NGFWs?","WAFs specialize in protecting web apps (HTTP/HTTPS) from attacks like SQL injection."
"What is UTM?","Unified Threat Management - combines firewall, IPS, VPN, and content filtering in one device."
"What are two limitations of legacy UTMs?","1) Often limited to Layer 4 2) Performance degradation with multiple features enabled."
"Why use application-aware firewalls?","To enforce policies like 'allow SQL Server but block social media posting' regardless of ports."
"What security standard often mandates WAFs?","PCI DSS for protecting payment systems and web applications."
"What logging capability do WAFs provide?","Records of blocked attacks (SQLi, XSS) with timestamps, URLs, and attacker IPs."
"What makes NGFWs 'stateful'?","They track connection states (e.g., established TCP sessions) for smarter filtering."
"What network function often coexists with firewalls?","NAT (Network Address Translation) for IP address conservation and security."
"What problem does deep packet inspection solve?","Identifies disguised malicious traffic that port-based firewalls would miss."
"Why might enterprises deploy both NGFW and WAF?","NGFW protects network perimeter while WAF guards specific web applications."
"What QoS feature might firewalls provide?","Bandwidth shaping to prioritize critical traffic (e.g., VoIP over web browsing)."
"How do firewalls enable parental controls?","Through URL filtering categories and time-based access rules."
"What is the primary purpose of a VPN?","To create secure encrypted tunnels over public networks for remote access to private resources."
"What two components form a VPN connection?","1) VPN concentrator (endpoint) 2) Client software (on user device)."
"How does IPsec tunneling protect data?","Encrypts original packet + headers, wraps in new IPsec headers for secure transport."
"What distinguishes SSL/TLS VPNs from IPsec VPNs?","SSL/TLS uses port 443 (web traffic), while IPsec is for site-to-site connections."
"Why are SSL VPNs firewall-friendly?","They use standard HTTPS port (443) which is rarely blocked by network policies."
"What problem does SD-WAN solve?","Inefficient cloud access in traditional WANs by enabling dynamic direct-to-cloud routing."
"How does SASE enhance SD-WAN?","Integrates cloud-native security (firewall, CASB) with SD-WAN connectivity."
"What are the three IPsec components in VPN tunneling?","1) Original encrypted packet 2) IPsec header/trailer 3) New routing header."
"Why might enterprises use both SSL and IPsec VPNs?","SSL for remote users, IPsec for site-to-site office connections."
"What security risk exists in VPN concentrators?","Decrypted traffic inside corporate network if not properly segmented."
"How does SD-WAN improve cloud application performance?","Routes traffic directly to cloud services instead of backhauling through data centers."
"What authentication methods do SSL VPNs support?","Credentials, certificates, or shared secrets for client verification."
"What is the 'always-on' VPN feature?","Automatically establishes VPN connection when device starts, maintaining constant protection."
"Why is SASE considered cloud-optimized?","Co-locates security services near cloud apps for low-latency protection."
"What visibility challenge exists with IPsec site-to-site VPNs?","Internal devices communicate normally - encryption is transparent to end users."
