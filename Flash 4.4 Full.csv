"Why is constant security monitoring important?","Because attackers continuously target systems and services, making real-time detection essential."
"What are key targets of security monitoring?","Logins/authentications, remote access, system performance, firewall/network traffic, backups, and software versions."
"What might abnormal login patterns indicate?","A potential attack, such as logins from countries with no employees."
"What could high data transfer volumes suggest?","Possible data exfiltration or unauthorized data movement."
"What is the purpose of security dashboards?","To provide centralized, real-time visualization of the organization's security posture."
"What challenge does log monitoring present?","Logs come in diverse formats and contain varied data, requiring consolidation for effective analysis."
"What is SIEM and what does it do?","Security Information and Event Manager; centralizes logs, correlates events, generates reports, and detects anomalies."
"What systems feed into a SIEM?","Firewalls, servers, routers, switches, and other infrastructure components."
"What security capabilities does a SIEM provide?","Report generation, access pattern detection, log correlation, and bandwidth anomaly monitoring."
"Why is vulnerability awareness critical in monitoring?","New vulnerabilities are constantly discovered and must be tracked to protect systems."
"What devices complicate security monitoring?","Mobile devices like laptops, phones, and tablets due to their dynamic connectivity."
"What is the role of regular scanning?","To identify OS versions, installed apps, device drivers, and potential anomalies."
"What happens with the data from scans?","It's fed into a central database to generate reports for action and compliance."
"What can security reports reveal?","Unpatched systems, outdated OS versions, and systems affected by new vulnerabilities."
"What are ad hoc security reports used for?","To simulate scenarios such as the impact of end-of-life operating systems."
"How long does it typically take to detect a breach, according to IBM 2022?","On average, about 9 months to detect and contain."
"What does breach detection latency emphasize?","The need for long-term data retention and solid backup strategies."
"Why are real-time alerts important?","They enable quick responses to incidents by highlighting urgent threats."
"Give examples of actionable real-time alerts.","Multiple failed logins (brute force), unusual outbound traffic (data exfiltration)."
"Why must alerts be actionable?","To help prioritize and streamline incident investigation and response efforts."
"What are examples of enterprise security tools?","Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs), Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), and vulnerability scanners."
"Why is log standardization important?","Because different tools generate varied logs and may describe the same vulnerabilities differently."
"What does SCAP stand for and who maintains it?","Security Content Automation Protocol, maintained by NIST (scap.nist.gov)."
"What is the purpose of SCAP?","To standardize vulnerability descriptions so different tools can recognize and act on them consistently."
"What does SCAP enable in security operations?","Automated vulnerability detection and remediation without human intervention."
"What are CIS benchmarks used for?","They provide best practices for securing operating systems, applications, and cloud environments."
"Give an example of a CIS benchmark for mobile devices.","Disabling screenshots, enforcing encrypted backups, etc."
"What are agent-based compliance checks?","They use installed software for continuous real-time compliance monitoring but require updates."
"What are agentless compliance checks?","They run temporarily (e.g., at VPN login), execute in memory, and remove themselves after scanning."
"What are the pros and cons of agentless compliance checks?","Lower maintenance but lack continuous monitoring."
"What does a SIEM do?","Centralizes logs from various sources, supports reporting, event correlation, and long-term forensic analysis."
"What types of data can SIEM reporting cover?","Firewall performance, VPN authentications, user logins, application use, etc."
"How does a SIEM help with forensics?","It stores long-term log data for retrospective investigation of incidents."
"What threats does malware protection cover?","Trojans, worms, macro viruses, ransomware, spyware, and fileless malware."
"Are antivirus and anti-malware still distinct tools?","No, their functions have largely merged and are now effectively the same."
"What does DLP stand for and what does it do?","Data Loss Prevention; it monitors and blocks transmission of sensitive data."
"Where can DLP be applied?","On endpoints, network appliances, and cloud-based systems."
"What does SNMP stand for and what is it used for?","Simple Network Management Protocol; it monitors system performance over the network."
"What port does SNMP use?","UDP port 161."
"What is an MIB in SNMP?","Management Information Base, a collection of Object Identifiers (OIDs) used to query device metrics."
"How does SNMP polling work?","A Network Management Station polls a device for metrics (e.g., bytes transferred), then repeats to detect changes."
