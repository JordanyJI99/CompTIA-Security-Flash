"What three measures are central to Zero Trust?","MFA, data encryption, and granular role-based permissions"
"What distinguishes Data Plane from Control Plane?","Data Plane handles traffic processing; Control Plane manages security policies/routing"
"What three factors do adaptive identity systems consider?","User behavior patterns, device trust status, and network connection context"
"How do security zones enhance protection?","By segmenting networks and removing implicit trust between zones"
"What three components enforce Zero Trust policies?","1. Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) 2. Policy Decision Point (PDP) 3. Policy Administrator"
"What happens when a remote user accesses cloud storage?","PEP checks request, PDP verifies context/MFA, limited access granted if approved"
"Why does Zero Trust require temporary credentials?","To enforce least-privilege access with time-bound permissions for specific resources"
"What example demonstrates security zone isolation?","Finance VLAN communicating only with HR servers, not guest WiFi networks"
"How does Zero Trust handle unknown location logins?","Triggers additional authentication steps and restricts access privileges"
"What three elements make PEP crucial?","1. Traffic inspection 2. Policy application 3. Acting as security gateway"
"What differentiates traditional networks from Zero Trust?","Traditional: Internal trust after firewall; Zero Trust: Verify-everything approach"
"What's included in a gap analysis report?","Current/desired state comparison, prioritized roadmap, and resource allocation plan"
"Why combine certificates with Zero Trust?","To validate device identity and enforce encryption for all communications"

"What are examples of physical barriers used in access control?","Concrete barriers, bollards, and bridges for controlled entry"
"What security feature prevents tailgating in secure buildings?","Access control vestibules (mantraps) that control entry and prevent unauthorized following"
"What distinguishes advanced mantraps from simple ones?","Advanced mantraps use badging systems and ID checks, while simple ones rely on basic locking"
"How do fences contribute to physical security?","They create visible boundaries and can be enhanced with razor wire, CCTV, and opaque materials"
"What surveillance features help in evidence collection?","CCTV with motion detection, facial recognition, and license plate reading"
"Why is two-person integrity important for security guards?","Prevents internal security breaches by requiring dual oversight"
