"What is an advantage of cloud capacity management?","Resources can be scaled up or down instantly, often with automation."
"Why is capacity planning still important in the cloud?","Because using more cloud resources increases costsâ€”you pay for what you use."
"What is the purpose of recovery testing?","To ensure everyone understands and can execute disaster recovery processes without affecting production systems."
"What does recovery testing involve?","Running through a specific scenario within a time frame and evaluating performance to update the recovery plan."
"What is a challenge of full recovery testing?","It can be expensive and require moving personnel and setting up infrastructure just for the test."
"What is a tabletop exercise in disaster recovery?","A low-cost method where participants verbally walk through disaster recovery steps without touching live systems."
"How does a tabletop exercise benefit the organization?","It identifies missed steps and improves coordination among teams without disrupting operations."
"What is a failover test?","A test to check whether redundant systems automatically take over when a failure occurs, ensuring availability."
"Why is automatic failover important?","It ensures seamless user experience and supports business continuity during infrastructure failure."
"What infrastructure components should be redundant for a successful failover test?","Routers, switches, firewalls, and internet links."
"How can failover be enhanced?","By using load balancers and multiple servers for each connection."
