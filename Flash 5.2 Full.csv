"What must you understand for the Security+ exam regarding risk assessments?","The types of risk assessments, when and why each is used, and how they relate to change control and regulations."
"What should you look for in a scenario to identify an ad hoc risk assessment?","A sudden or specific new threat prompted by executives or recent events."
"What type of assessment is being described if it's done periodically or due to policy?","A scheduled or mandated risk assessment."
"What is the purpose of a qualitative risk assessment?","To evaluate risk factors using broad terms like low, medium, and high to provide a high-level view of overall risk."
"What tool can be used to visually represent a qualitative risk assessment?","A traffic light grid representation."
"What factors are considered in qualitative risk assessments?","Impact, annualized rate of occurrence, and cost of controls."
"What is the goal of a qualitative risk assessment?","To focus efforts on resolving the most important problems based on broad risk levels."
"What does a quantitative risk assessment calculate?","A specific monetary value for risk."
"What is the Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)?","How often a risk is expected to occur in a single year."
"What is Asset Value (AV) in risk assessment?","The total value of an asset to the organization, including replacement cost, lost sales, fines, and more."
"What is the Exposure Factor (EF)?","The percentage of asset value lost due to a specific risk, expressed as a decimal between 0.0 and 1.0."
"How is Single-Loss Expectancy (SLE) calculated?","SLE = AV × EF."
"How is Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) calculated?","ALE = ARO × SLE."
"What does ALE represent?","The expected monetary loss per year due to a specific risk."
"What types of impacts are considered in risk calculations?","Life, property, safety, and financial impacts."
"What is the difference between likelihood and probability in risk analysis?","Likelihood is qualitative (e.g., rare, likely); probability is quantitative and based on data."
"What is risk appetite?","The amount of risk an organization is willing to accept, often described with terms like conservative or expansionary."
"What is risk tolerance?","The acceptable deviation above risk appetite; it varies depending on circumstances."
"What analogy helps explain risk appetite and tolerance?","Speed limit (appetite) vs. the speed that results in a ticket (tolerance)."
"What is the purpose of a risk register?","To document and manage risks associated with a project, including possible solutions."
"What does each risk entry in a risk register include?","A Key Risk Indicator (KRI), a risk owner, and a defined threshold."
"What is a Key Risk Indicator (KRI)?","A metric that identifies a specific risk in the risk register (e.g., unclear schedule)."
"Why is balancing risk resolution cost important?","Because the cost to fix a risk should not exceed the potential cost of the risk occurring."
"What is the goal of a risk treatment strategy?","To determine how an organization will handle specific risks."
"What does it mean to transfer a risk?","To move responsibility for the risk to another party, such as through cybersecurity insurance."
"What is an example of risk transference?","Purchasing cybersecurity insurance to cover potential losses from cyber incidents."
"What does it mean to accept a risk?","To acknowledge the risk and choose not to act beyond current measures, often documented through policy exceptions."
"When might a company accept a risk?","When a device cannot be patched due to vendor restrictions or when a patch conflicts with critical software."
"What does it mean to avoid a risk?","To completely eliminate the risk from the environment, removing the need for further controls."
"What is an example of avoiding a risk?","Disabling or removing a risky system or process entirely."
"What does it mean to mitigate a risk?","To reduce the impact or likelihood of a risk through specific actions or controls."
"What is an example of risk mitigation?","Installing a next-generation firewall to reduce internet-based threats."
"What is risk reporting?","The process of tracking and documenting all identified risks and their handling plans."
"What is included in a risk report?","Descriptions of risks, their handling strategies, and relevance to business decisions."
"Who typically references risk reports in an organization?","Upper management, for decisions on investments and risk management."
"How often is a risk report updated?","It is a living document that is updated continuously as risks evolve."
"What types of risks are commonly emphasized in risk reports?","Critical and emerging risks relevant to management decisions."
"What does RTO stand for?","Recovery Time Objective."
"What is the Recovery Time Objective (RTO)?","The maximum acceptable time to restore operations after an outage."
"What does RTO measure?","The time needed to get systems back online and operational, such as databases or web servers."
"What does RPO stand for?","Recovery Point Objective."
"What is the Recovery Point Objective (RPO)?","The maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time."
"What does RPO define?","How current the data must be once systems are restored (e.g., last 12 months of data)."
"What does MTTR stand for?","Mean Time to Repair."
"What is Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)?","The average time it takes to diagnose, repair, and restore service after a failure."
"What factors affect MTTR?","Diagnosis time, spare parts availability, technician expertise, and support contracts."
"How can organizations reduce MTTR?","By investing in faster support, keeping spare parts on site, or contracting third-party services."
"What does MTBF stand for?","Mean Time Between Failures."
"What is Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)?","The average time a system operates before experiencing a failure."
"How is MTBF used?","To plan equipment usage and assess failure risk over time."
"How is MTBF calculated?","By dividing the total operational time by the number of breakdowns."
