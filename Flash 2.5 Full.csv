"What is network segmentation?","Dividing a network into isolated sections to limit breaches, improve performance, and enforce policies."  
"What is logical segmentation?","Using VLANs or virtual networks to isolate traffic without physical separation."  
"Why segment networks?","To restrict access to sensitive resources (e.g., databases) and meet compliance (e.g., PCI DSS)."  
"What is an Access Control List (ACL)?","Rules allowing/denying traffic based on IP, port, time, or user identity (via firewalls, routers, etc.)."  
"What ACL mistake should be avoided?","Configuring rules that accidentally lock admins out of systems."  
"What is application segmentation?","Controlling software execution via allow/deny lists (e.g., blocking unauthorized apps)."  
"How does Windows enforce application control?","Using hashes, digital signatures, file path restrictions, and network zone rules."  
"What is the purpose of patching?","Fixing security flaws to prevent exploits (e.g., emergency patches for critical vulnerabilities)."  
"What is full disk encryption (FDE)?","Encrypting entire storage volumes (e.g., BitLocker) to protect data if devices are stolen."  
"What does the Principle of Least Privilege enforce?","Users get minimal access needed for their role, reducing breach impact."  
"What is posture assessment?","Checking systems for compliance (patches, antivirus) before granting network access."  
"How to securely decommission hardware?","Wipe/destroy storage drives (SSDs, USBs) to prevent data leaks."  
"What is a SIEM system?","Security Information and Event Management tools that consolidate logs for threat detection."  
"What mitigates privilege escalation?","Patching, anti-malware, Data Execution Prevention (DEP), and ASLR."  
"What are allow/deny lists?","Allow: Only approved apps run. Deny: Block specific apps (common in antivirus tools)."  
"Why use VLANs for segmentation?","To logically isolate traffic (e.g., guest vs. internal networks) without physical changes."  
"What is file-level encryption?","Encrypting individual files/folders (e.g., EFS) vs. full disks (FDE)."  
"What risks exist in ACL misconfiguration?","Overly strict rules blocking legitimate traffic or creating security gaps."  
"What is system hardening?","Securing the OS by patching vulnerabilities, limiting user privileges, and encrypting data."  
"Why patch operating systems?","To fix security flaws and prevent exploits targeting known vulnerabilities."  
"What is the Principle of Least Privilege?","Granting users only the minimum permissions needed to perform their tasks."  
"What is Full Disk Encryption (FDE)?","Encrypting the entire storage volume (e.g., BitLocker) to protect data at rest."  
"What distinguishes EDR from traditional antivirus?","EDR uses behavioral analysis, machine learning, and automated response, not just signatures."  
"What does a host-based firewall do?","Controls inbound/outbound traffic at the OS level, including process-level network access."  
"What is HIPS?","Host-based Intrusion Prevention System: Blocks attacks by monitoring OS behavior and configurations."  
"Why close unused ports?","To reduce attack surfaces (e.g., preventing unauthorized access via open ports)."  
"How does port scanning (e.g., Nmap) help security?","Identifies open ports to verify firewall rules and detect unintended exposures."  
"Why change default credentials on management interfaces?","Attackers exploit default usernames/passwords to gain control of devices."  
"What is multi-factor authentication (MFA) for management interfaces?","Requiring a second factor (e.g., token, biometric) beyond passwords for access."  
"Why remove unused applications?","Eliminates potential vulnerabilities and simplifies patch management."  
"What is endpoint hardening?","Securing devices (e.g., laptops, phones) with layered defenses like EDR and firewalls."  
"What role does behavioral analysis play in EDR?","Detects malware by monitoring unusual user/application activity patterns."  
"How does encryption protect network traffic?","VPNs/HTTPS encrypt data in transit to prevent eavesdropping or MITM attacks."  
"What is a key feature of Next-Gen firewalls?","Granular port control based on applications, not just port numbers."  
"What does HIPS monitor in the OS?","Buffer overflows, registry changes, and unauthorized system file modifications."  
"What is defense in depth?","Using multiple security layers (e.g., firewalls, EDR, encryption) for endpoint hardening."
