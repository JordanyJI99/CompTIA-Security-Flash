"What is Access Control?","It's the process of enforcing policies that allow or deny access to data or resources after a user authenticates."
"Who translates access policies into OS-level permissions?","Administrators translate access policies into OS-level permissions."
"What is the principle of Least Privilege?","Grant users only the permissions they need to perform their job."
"What are two goals of the Least Privilege principle?","To prevent excessive access and to minimize damage from malware."
"What type of privileges do users have by default under Least Privilege?","Limited rights, not administrative privileges."
"What does MAC stand for in access control?","Mandatory Access Control."
"Who sets the access rules in Mandatory Access Control (MAC)?","Administrators set the access rules."
"What is used in MAC to classify data and users?","Security labels such as Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret."
"In what environments is MAC commonly used?","High-security environments like military or classified settings."
"What does DAC stand for in access control?","Discretionary Access Control."
"Who controls access permissions in DAC?","The data creator or owner."
"What is a key drawback of DAC?","It's less secure because it relies on individual user decisions."
"What does RBAC stand for when referring to job roles?","Role-Based Access Control."
"How are permissions assigned in Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)?","Permissions are assigned to roles (groups), and users inherit them by being added to those roles."
"What are benefits of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)?","It's centralized, scalable, and reduces human error."
"What does the other RBAC stand for (not role-based)?","Rule-Based Access Control."
"How is access determined in Rule-Based Access Control?","By rules defined by the administrator, applied to objects."
"Can users define their own access in Rule-Based Access Control?","No, access is determined by the system administrator."
"Give an example of a Rule-Based Access Control policy.","Access allowed only from 9 AM to 5 PM, or only via Chrome browser."
"What does ABAC stand for?","Attribute-Based Access Control."
"What type of access control is ABAC considered?","A modern, next-generation access control model."
"What attributes can ABAC consider when making access decisions?","IP address, time of day, requested action, user's relationship to the data."
"What is a benefit of ABAC?","It allows highly granular access control using multiple attributes."
"What is an example of ABAC in action?","Access granted if the user is in R&D, using the company VPN, and during work hours."
"What are Time-of-Day Restrictions in access control?","Controls that restrict access based on specific time or day."
"Can Time-of-Day Restrictions be combined with other models?","Yes, they are supplementary and can work with other access control models."
"What is a challenge when implementing Time-of-Day Restrictions in global organizations?","Time zone differences must be accounted for."
"What is an authentication factor in cybersecurity?","A parameter used for verifying a user’s identity, such as a password, device, or biometrics."
"What are the common authentication factors?","Something you know, something you have, something you are, somewhere you are."
"What does 'Something You Know' refer to?","Information you memorize, such as a password, PIN, or pattern unlock on your mobile device."
"Examples of 'Something You Know' authentication?","Password, PIN, mobile phone/tablet unlock pattern."
"What does 'Something You Have' refer to?","Physical items you possess, like a smart card, USB security key, or mobile phone."
"Examples of 'Something You Have' authentication?","Smart card ID, USB security key, hardware token, software token, SMS codes."
"What is a smart card ID used for in multi-factor authentication?","It’s an ID embedded in a card that you insert into a device, often used with a PIN."
"What is a USB security key?","A physical device that contains a unique certificate used to authenticate you when plugged into a system."
"What is a hardware token?","A device that generates randomized numbers, which you must input during login to authenticate."
"How do software tokens work?","Mobile apps generate codes that function like hardware tokens, eliminating the need for an additional physical device."
"What is SMS-based authentication?","A code sent to your phone via SMS, used as a second factor for login."
"What does 'Something You Are' refer to in MFA?","Biometric authentication factors, like fingerprints or voiceprints."
"Examples of 'Something You Are' authentication?","Fingerprint, voiceprint, or other unique personal characteristics."
"How does biometric authentication work?","A mathematical representation of the biometric is stored and compared during authentication, not the actual image."
"What is the difficulty of changing 'Something You Are' factors?","They are very difficult to modify (e.g., fingerprints or voiceprints)."
"Why are biometrics often used with other authentication factors?","Because biometrics can be circumvented, so multiple factors improve security."
"What does 'Somewhere You Are' refer to in MFA?","Location-based authentication using data like GPS or IP address."
"Examples of 'Somewhere You Are' authentication?","Blocking logins from different countries, using IP addresses, or combining IP and GPS location data."
"How is geolocation used in MFA?","It checks your location through IP or GPS data to allow or block system access based on your physical location."
"What is the goal of password creation and strength?","To create passwords that are difficult for attackers to guess and prevent attacks like password spraying or brute force."
"What does entropy mean in password security?","Entropy refers to how unpredictable a password is, and the goal is to increase it for better security."
"What are the requirements for a strong password?","Avoid single words or obvious choices, use a mix of upper/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, and have a minimum length, typically 8+ characters."
"Why should you use a passphrase or set of words for longer passwords?","Using a phrase or set of words can increase password length and complexity, making it harder to guess."
"What is password age?","Password age refers to the time that has passed since a password was set, determining its validity period."
"What happens when a password expires?","Once a password expires, the user will be unable to log in until the password is changed."
"Why do systems remember past passwords?","Systems store past passwords to prevent users from reusing them, increasing security."
"How do password expiration policies work?","Administrators set password expiration policies, often requiring changes at regular intervals (e.g., 30, 60, or 90 days)."
"What is a best practice regarding password use?","Using a different password for each account limits the impact of a single password compromise."
"What is the purpose of a password manager?","To store and manage all your passwords in one encrypted database, simplifying password management."
"How do password managers improve security?","They encrypt the database, often require additional authentication, and help generate and store unique passwords."
"What features do password managers have?","They can generate random passwords, check password health (e.g., compromised passwords), and automatically fill in login forms."
"Why is password reuse a problem?","Password reuse across different sites makes data vulnerable to attackers, especially if one site is compromised."
"What is passwordless authentication?","A method that eliminates traditional passwords, allowing users to log in without typing a password."
"What are examples of passwordless authentication?","Face recognition for mobile phones or PIN-based login for operating systems like Windows."
"How is passwordless authentication typically used?","It is often used in combination with an initial password or other authentication factors for added security."
"What are Just-in-Time (JIT) permissions?","A method that provides temporary administrative access when needed, with time-limited credentials that automatically expire."
"How does JIT permissions work?","A user requests temporary administrative access, which is granted by a clearinghouse based on security policies and deleted after use."
"What are the benefits of JIT permissions?","JIT allows admins to access privileges only when necessary, reducing the risk of permanent administrative access if an account is compromised."
