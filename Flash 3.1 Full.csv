"What is the shared responsibility model in cloud computing?","Security responsibilities divided between provider and customer based on service model (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)."
"Who manages most security in SaaS?","The cloud provider handles most security; customer manages accounts and data access."
"What security aspects does a customer control in IaaS?","OS, applications, data, and identity management (provider handles physical infrastructure)."

"What is hybrid cloud?","Using multiple cloud providers (e.g., AWS + Azure) with some on-premises infrastructure."
"What are challenges of multi-cloud environments?","Configuration inconsistencies, differing logs/terminology, and secure data transfer needs."
"Why encrypt data between cloud providers?","Public internet transfers are vulnerable; encryption prevents eavesdropping/MITM attacks."
"What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?","Defining and deploying cloud infrastructure via code (not manual setup) for consistency."
"What are benefits of serverless/FaaS?","Pay-per-use cost model, no server management, automatic scaling, and simplified deployment."
"How do microservices improve security?","Granular security per service, isolation of failures, and API-based communication controls."
"What's the difference between monolithic and microservices?","Monolithic = single executable; Microservices = small, independent services communicating via APIs."
"What security advantage does PaaS offer over IaaS?","Provider manages OS and middleware; customer focuses on apps/data (less patching needed)."
"Why monitor third-party cloud tools?","To detect misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in external firewalls/SaaS applications."
"What is vendor risk management in cloud?","Assessing third-party providers' security practices before integration."
"How does IaC help with cloud consistency?","Code templates ensure identical deployments across environments/regions."
"What security benefit does FaaS provide?","Reduced attack surface (no persistent servers) and built-in cloud provider security."
"What is physical isolation in networking?","Separating devices physically (air gap) to prevent communication between them, like different server racks."
"What is a limitation of physical isolation?","Impractical for large networks (e.g., needing 100 switches for 100 clients)."
"What technology solves physical isolation limitations?","VLANs (Virtual LANs) enable logical segmentation on shared physical switches."
"What are the three planes of network operation?","1) Data Plane (traffic forwarding) 2) Control Plane (routing decisions) 3) Management Plane (device config)."
"What functions does the Data Plane handle?","Packet forwarding, NAT, encryption, and trunking operations."
"What is the Control Plane responsible for?","Maintaining routing tables and making path decisions for network traffic."
"How does the Management Plane differ?","Used for device configuration via interfaces like SSH/SNMP, affecting other planes."
"What is SDN (Software Defined Networking)?","Virtualizes network infrastructure for dynamic cloud-based configuration management."
"What can SDN enable?","Flexible insertion of security controls (e.g., firewalls between web/database tiers)."
"Why use VLANs instead of physical separation?","More scalable security segmentation without requiring dedicated hardware per network."
"What's an example of Data Plane operation?","A switch forwarding packets between devices on the same VLAN."
"What controls routing protocol updates?","The Control Plane handles dynamic routing updates like OSPF or BGP changes."
"How does Management Plane access work?","Through secure protocols like SSH for configuring network devices remotely."
"What problem does SDN solve in cloud networks?","Enables rapid reconfiguration without physical changes to network devices."
"What are key advantages of cloud security?","No physical hardware management, provider-handled security, and no data center maintenance."
"What's the main benefit of on-premises security?","Complete control over security policies and infrastructure."
"How do attackers view cloud vs on-premises systems?","They target both equally, focusing on bypassing security measures regardless of location."
"What makes decentralized environments challenging?","Managing diverse systems across multiple locations/clouds with varying OSes and policies."
"What do centralized monitoring solutions provide?","Unified visibility of users/devices, centralized logging, and scalable alerting systems."
"How does virtualization differ from containerization?","VMs run separate guest OSes, while containers share a host OS for greater efficiency."
"What are three benefits of containerization?","Resource efficiency, rapid deployment, and isolated application security."
"Why are IoT devices risky for networks?","Often built with weak security by non-IT companies; one device can compromise entire networks."
"What makes SCADA systems uniquely vulnerable?","Critical infrastructure impact; breaches can cause long-term physical damage."
"How do RTOS differ from standard OSes?","RTOS are deterministic (precise timing) for industrial/military systems vs. shared-resource OSes."
"What defines embedded systems?","Non-configurable, single-purpose devices with locked-down OS (e.g., traffic lights, medical monitors)."
"How does High Availability (HA) differ from redundancy?","HA automatically fails over; redundancy may require manual intervention during outages."
"What are the two HA configuration types?","Active-passive (standby backup) and active-active (continuous load sharing)."
"What cost factors affect HA implementations?","Duplicate hardware, separate networks/power, and business risk assessments."
"Why are containers better for microservices?","Lightweight isolation enables rapid scaling without full OS overhead per service."
"What security risk exists in centralized monitoring?","Single point of failure if the management console is compromised."
"What is availability in infrastructure?","System uptime ensuring resources are accessible when needed, often measured as a percentage (e.g., 99.999%)."
"What does MTTR measure?","Mean Time to Repair - the average duration to restore systems after an outage."
"What three cost factors affect IT infrastructure?","1) Initial installation 2) Ongoing maintenance 3) Replacement/depreciation costs."
"How does responsiveness differ from availability?","Responsiveness measures service speed during operation, while availability measures access to the service."
"What enables cloud elasticity?","Automatic scaling of resources (up/down) based on real-time demand without over-provisioning."
"Why is change control critical for cloud?","Manages deployment risks and complexity in dynamic cloud environments."
"What does cybersecurity insurance typically cover?","Financial losses from breaches including downtime, legal fees, and ransomware payments."
"What's the disaster recovery advantage of backups?","Faster system restoration (e.g., from malware) vs. OS reinstallation."
"Why test patches before deployment?","To prevent disruptions from buggy updates while maintaining security/availability."
"How to secure unpatchable embedded systems?","Network isolation, firewalls, and strict access controls."
"What are two power backup solutions?","1) UPS (short-term) 2) Generators (long-term outages)."
