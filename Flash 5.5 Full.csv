"Why is physical security important in penetration testing?","Because physical access allows bypassing OS security by modifying boot processes or replacing OS files."
"What are the roles of the Red Team and Blue Team in penetration testing?","Red Team attacks and exploits vulnerabilities (offensive), Blue Team defends by identifying and blocking attacks (defensive)."
"What is the ideal interaction between Red and Blue Teams?","Red Team finds vulnerabilities and shares findings with Blue Team to patch and improve defense."
"What are the three types of penetration test environments?","Known Environment (full disclosure), Partially Known Environment, and Unknown Environment (blind test)."
"What is the reconnaissance phase in penetration testing?","Gathering information about security tools, servers, applications, and network topology before launching an attack."
"What is passive reconnaissance?","Gathering information without direct interaction with the target, e.g., via social media, public websites, or dumpster diving."
"Why is passive reconnaissance important?","It allows gathering info without alerting the target or being detected."
"What is active reconnaissance?","Direct interaction with the target network, such as ping scans, port scans, or OS fingerprinting."
"What is a key risk of active reconnaissance?","It can be detected by the target through logs or alerts."
"Give examples of active reconnaissance techniques.","Ping scans, port scans, DNS queries, OS scans, and version detection."
