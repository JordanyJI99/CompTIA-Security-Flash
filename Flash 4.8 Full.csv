"What is a security incident?","An event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information or systems, such as malware, DDoS attacks, or data exfiltration."
"What NIST publication is key for managing security incidents?","NIST Special Publication 800-61 Revision 2: Computer Security Incident Handling Guide."
"What are the four phases of the NIST incident handling lifecycle?","Preparation, Detection and Analysis, Containment/Eradication/Recovery, Post-Incident Activity."
"Why is preparation critical in incident response?","Because it ensures systems, policies, tools, and people are ready to respond efficiently before an incident occurs."
"What is included in the preparation phase?","Communication methods, contact lists, incident go bags, system documentation, policies, training, and known-good system images."
"What is an incident go bag?","A portable kit with hardware, forensic software, and tools needed to handle incidents on-site."
"Why is on-the-job training during an incident discouraged?","Because incidents require immediate, informed action, not time-consuming learning."
"What is the main challenge in the detection and analysis phase?","Differentiating real security breaches from background noise or false positives."
"What tools help with incident detection?","Logs, IPS alerts, antivirus software, and system monitoring tools."
"What are some indicators of a possible attack?","Unusual network traffic, IPS alerts, malware reports, or direct attacker contact."
"What is the priority in the containment phase?","Stop the attack immediately to limit damage, not observe it in production."
"What is a sandbox and its role in incident response?","A controlled environment for analyzing malware without affecting live systems."
"Why can malware behave differently in a sandbox?","Some malware detects virtual environments and self-destructs or hides behavior."
"What actions are part of the recovery phase?","Removing malware, reimaging systems, disabling breached accounts, and restoring from backups."
"What is the purpose of using known-good backups in recovery?","To ensure no malicious code or corrupted data remains in the system."
"What is the goal after recovering from an incident?","To restore systems securely and block future attacker access."
"What is the purpose of post-incident activity?","To review the response, identify improvements, and update procedures for future incidents."
"What are key questions in post-incident review?","What happened? What was the timeline? What worked or failed? What should be improved?"
"Why is it important to update monitoring after an incident?","To detect previously missed indicators and prevent future attacks."
"How can post-incident analysis reduce future risk?","By identifying gaps in planning and improving response procedures and tools."
"What is the purpose of pre-incident testing?","To evaluate the effectiveness of documented response plans and test security skills before a real event occurs."
"Why should pre-incident testing be done on test systems?","To avoid disrupting or damaging production systems during exercises."
"What is a common limitation of security exercises?","They are time-limited because participants often have other responsibilities."
"Why are post-exercise meetings important?","To evaluate the exercise results and identify process improvements."
"What is a tabletop exercise?","A discussion-based session where participants walk through incident response procedures without launching real attacks."
"What is the main benefit of a tabletop exercise?","It allows policy and procedure testing without requiring a full-scale drill."
"How long does a tabletop exercise usually take?","A few hours, often focusing on one scenario."
"What is a simulation in incident testing?","A simulated attack used to observe how systems and users respond."
"What are examples of simulation testing?","Phishing emails, social engineering attempts, or data exfiltration trials."
"What is a phishing simulation?","A test where the security team sends fake phishing emails to see if users fall for them and to test system defenses."
"What are goals of phishing simulations?","Identify susceptible users, test filters and monitoring tools, and improve training and detection."
"Why conduct post-simulation evaluations?","To assess performance, identify weaknesses, and deliver additional user training."
"What is root cause analysis in incident response?","The process of identifying how an attacker initially gained access to the system."
"Why is root cause analysis important?","It reveals which systems or processes failed, helping prevent future breaches."
"What evidence is used in root cause analysis?","Log files, attacker artifacts, and activity reconstructions."
"Why look for multiple root causes?","Because attackers often use several entry points or techniques to access systems."
"What human factor is often addressed in root cause analysis?","User mistakes, such as falling for social engineering attacks."
"What is threat hunting?","The proactive search for vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them."
"What are examples of threat hunting activities?","Checking for unpatched systems, updating firewall rules, and monitoring new vulnerabilities."
"What is the main challenge of threat hunting?","Identifying attacks before they actually occur."
"What is the goal of threat hunting?","To prevent security incidents before they happen."
"How does system monitoring contribute to security?","It helps detect and stop attacks early using logs, alerts, and automated responses."
"What is the advantage of automation in monitoring?","It can respond to threats even when security staff are not actively monitoring systems."
"What is digital forensics?","The process of collecting, analyzing, and reporting data during a security event to understand what happened and support legal actions."
"Why are detailed notes important in digital forensics?","To document how data was obtained, which is essential for integrity and legal admissibility."
"What is a legal hold?","A request from a legal entity to preserve specific types of electronically stored information (ESI) for potential legal action."
"Who is responsible for evaluating a legal hold and acquiring data?","The data custodian, who has access to the requested data."
"Why can acquiring data under legal hold be complex?","Because it may involve large databases or proprietary formats that require conversion."
"What is ESI in the context of digital forensics?","Electronically Stored Information that must be preserved when a legal hold is issued."
"What is the chain of custody?","A documented process that tracks access to evidence to ensure its integrity and admissibility in court."
"How is integrity maintained in digital forensics?","Using digital hashes and signatures to prove data has not been altered."
"Why is a chain of custody required for each data element?","To ensure that all evidence remains unaltered and can be trusted during legal or investigative processes."
"What is the first step in the forensic process?","Data acquisition from relevant sources like disks, memory, or logs."
"What are some common data sources in forensic acquisition?","Disks, system memory, firmware, file systems, network devices, and virtual machines."
"Where can useful forensic data sometimes be found unexpectedly?","In log files, the recycle bin, temporary storage, saved logins, and browser bookmarks."
"Why is documentation important in forensic acquisition?","To ensure the process is repeatable, verifiable, and legally admissible."
"What do forensic reports typically include?","A summary of the event, acquisition details, data analysis, and possibly conclusions about the incident."
"Why are forensic reports important for legal cases?","They provide detailed documentation of acquisition and handling methods, supporting evidence credibility."
"Why make a copy of original data for analysis?","To preserve the original, unmodified source and prevent data loss or alteration."
"Why is live data collection important?","Because some systems (especially encrypted ones) lock down or erase data when powered off."
"How should mobile devices be handled in forensics?","Make a copy immediately, as they can be remotely wiped at any time."
"What is e-discovery?","The legal process of collecting and producing electronic data without requiring analysis."
"How does e-discovery differ from digital forensics?","E-discovery focuses on data collection, while forensics includes analysis and interpretation of that data."
"What is the relationship between e-discovery and forensics?","E-discovery may gather data (e.g., drive images) which are later analyzed by forensics professionals."
"Why is following best practices critical in data preservation?","Because the data may be needed years later in legal or security contexts, and its integrity must be unquestionable."
